# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Type check calls with `*args` or `**kwargs` (#275)
- Infer more precise types for comprehensions over known iterables (#279)
- Add impl function for `list.__iadd__` (`+=`) (#280)
- Simplify some overly complex types to improve performance (#280)
- Detect usage of implicitly reexported names (#271)
- Improve type inference for iterables (#277)
- Fix bug in type narrowing for `in`/`not in` (#277)
- Changes affecting consumers of `Value` objects:
  - All `Value` objects are now expected to be hashable.
  - `DictIncompleteValue` and `AnnotatedValue` use tuples instead of lists internally.

## Version 0.4.0 (November 18, 2021)

- Support and test Python 3.10. Note that new features are not necessarily
  supported.
- Support PEP 655 (`typing_extensions.Required` and `NotRequired`)
- Improve detection of missing return statements
- Improve detection of suspicious boolean conditions
- The return type of calls with `*args` or `**kwargs` is now inferred
  correctly. The arguments are still not typechecked.
- Fix bug affecting type compatibility between literals and generics
- Improve type narrowing on the `in`/`not in` operator
- Improve type checking for format strings
- Add the `pyanalyze.value.AnyValue` class, replacing `pyanalyze.value.UNRESOLVED_VALUE`
- Improve formatting for `Union` types in errors
- Fix bug affecting type compatibility between types and literals
- Support `total=False` in `TypedDict`
- Deal with typeshed changes in `typeshed_client` 1.1.2
- Better type checking for `list` and `tuple.__getitem__`
- Improve type narrowing on the `==`/`!=` operator
- Reduce usage of `VariableNameValue`
- Improve `TypeVar` inference procedure
- Add support for constraints on the type of `self`, including if it has a union type
- Detect undefined `enum.Enum` members
- Improve handling of `Annotated`
- Add `pyanalyze.extensions.CustomCheck`
- Add `pyanalyze.extensions.ExternalType`
- If you have code dealing with `Value` objects, note that there are several changes:
  - The `UnresolvedValue` class was renamed to `AnyValue`. 
  - `value is UNRESOLVED_VALUE` will no longer be reliable. Use `isinstance(value, AnyValue)` instead.
  - `TypedDictValue` now stores whether each key is required or not in its `items` dictionary.
  - `UnboundMethodValue` now stores a `Composite` object instead of a `Value` object, and has a new
    `typevars` field.
  - There is a new `KnownValueWithTypeVars` class, but it should not be relevant to most use cases.
